Yttria stabilized Zirconia
==========================

A simple thermodynamic model of yttria-stabilised zirconia is devel- oped. The framework of mixture theory coupled with the Maxwellâ€™s equa- tions is used to investigate the capacitance of the diffuse double layer under equilibrium conditions.

Using the two point flux finite volume method, the model is translated into a numerical simulation model.
