################## Typical basic usage ######################
#
# Function "meta_run_par_study()" in "ysz_fitting.jl" file can perform parametrical study.
# Its behavior is still defined in the body of the function. 
# It can 
#   1) call the "run_par_study()" function directly (via parameter direct_bool) 
#   OR 
#   2) by using a custom made external script file (for example used for running a job on a computational cluster).
# 
# You specify the parametrical study by
#   name = "GAS_LoMA_ULTRA_level_2"     # of the parametrical study
#   prms_names = ["A0", "R0", "K0", "DGA", "DGR", "DGO", "DD"]
#   prms_lists 
#   scripted_tuple        # which defines, how many cluster jobs (external calls of the script) will be called
#                         # and how many sets of prms will be tried in the called "run_par_study()"
#                         # 
#                         # (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) means al combinations of A0 and R0 will be distributed to 
#                         # differents jobs (calls of the script). And all combinations of the rest of parameters 
#                         # will be tried in each job (e.g. cluster node) by a funtion "run_par_study()"
#                         # ... simply ... if you just want run par_study on one computer (no cluster), use (0,0,0,0,0,0,0) :)
#                         
#   TC, pO2, bias                   # experimental setting lists can be used instead of single value to perform more simulations
#   simulations = ["EIS", "CV"]             # which type of simulation should be performed for each experimental setting
#   save_dir = "../data/par_studies/"       # by default. The par_study will be saved in a folder with its name
#
# All the info about par_study will be stored in "__metafile_par_study.txt"
# The behavior of meta_run_par_study is further specified by variables 
#   bash_command    # which command use to run the outer script
#   mode = "test_one_prms"  --> from the whole prms_lists chooses "the middle" one set or prms and perform par_study
#                               serves as a test of the path before the run of big dataset par_study
#   mode = "only_print"     --> only print the atributes of actually defined par_study 
#                               as well as the count of future (jobs / number of prms per each job)
#   mode = "go"             --> runs the par_study
#   run_file_name   # which script file will be run by the bash_command
